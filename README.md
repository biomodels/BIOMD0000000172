# BIOMD0000000172: Pritchard2002_glycolysis

## Installation

Download this repository, and install with distutils

`python setup.py install`

Or, install using pip

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/BIOMD0000000172.git`

To install a specific version (in this example, from the 2014-09-16 BioModels release)

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/BIOMD0000000172.git@20140916`

## Usage

Importing the model package.

`import BIOMD0000000172 as model`

Get the SBML string from the model

`print model.sbmlString`

If [python-libsbml](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-libsbml) bindings are
installed, the libsbml.SBMLDocument object is also accessible

`model.sbml`


# Model Notes


from:  
**Schemes of fluc control in a model of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ glycolysis **

**Pritchard, L and Kell, DB** _Eur. J. Biochem._ 269(2002), 3894-3904.   
It represents a modified version of **Teusink et al.** _Eur. J. Biochem._
267(2000), 5313-5329.  
The model is a translation from the GEPASI file encoded by Leighton Pritchard.  
This version uses the Vmaxes found by the best fit (R1) of Table 1 of the
Pritchard and Kell paper and simulates a decrease of external glucose
concentration from 100 to 2 mM.  
To reproduce the values in table 2 of the publication, set _GLCo_ to 50 mM and
compute the steady state.
