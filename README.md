**Schemes of fluc control in a model of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ glycolysis **

**Pritchard, L and Kell, DB** _Eur. J. Biochem._ 269(2002), 3894-3904.   
It represents a modified version of **Teusink et al.** _Eur. J. Biochem._
267(2000), 5313-5329.  
The model is a translation from the GEPASI file encoded by Leighton Pritchard.  
This version uses the Vmaxes found by the best fit (R1) of Table 1 of the
Pritchard and Kell paper and simulates a decrease of external glucose
concentration from 100 to 2 mM.  
To reproduce the values in table 2 of the publication, set _GLCo_ to 50 mM and
compute the steady state.
